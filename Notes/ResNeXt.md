# Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks Saining
**TL,DR**:

**Key points**:

**Notes/ Question**:
- I think the reason that make the power of the model is the sepearate and aggregate transformation block. This allow the model learn more and more feature while not make it become more complex and huge.
