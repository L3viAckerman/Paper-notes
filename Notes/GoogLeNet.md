# Going Deeper with Convolutions Christian
**TL,DR**: The authors presented the new architecture named that Inception module. The paper's hallmark is improved utilization of the computing resource inside the network. The model is builded based on Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

**Key points**:
- The authors use a wide receptive fields from 3 to 5 filter to capture much more about the image.
- To make efficient of computation, the authors use 1x1 convolution as a projection space and reduce the number of filters.
